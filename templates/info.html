        <h2 id="section---BenignVs.MalignantTumors">Benign vs. Malignant Tumors</h2>
        <p>There are two main classifications of tumors. One is known as benign and the other as malignant. A&nbsp;<strong>benign tumor</strong>&nbsp;is a tumor that does not invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body. A&nbsp;<strong>malignant tumor</strong>&nbsp;is a tumor that may invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body.</p>
        <p>I sometimes compare benign tumors to gentle European bees that typically don't bother people or cause them much harm. If you get too close, though, you might get stung, but that's usually it. Similarly, benign tumors on rare occasion may actually be life-threatening, but as a general rule aren't nearly as bad as the malignant tumors.</p>
        <p>The malignant tumors are like those killer bees. You don't even have to be doing anything to them or be anywhere close to their hive, and they'll just spread out and attack you en masse - even kill you if they're severe enough.</p>
        <h2 id="section---MacroscopicDifferences">Macroscopic Differences</h2>
        <p>Just like you'd want to tell the differences between gentle bees and killer bees, you'd want to know the very general and stereotypical characteristics between benign and malignant tumors. For instance, we know that killer bees are usually bigger than gentler bees. Well, we can use these types of visually observable or palpable differences for tumors as well.</p>
        <p>Benign tumors usually grow very slowly, while malignant tumors grow more quickly in size. To put that into a more specific perspective, it may take months or years for a benign tumor to change significantly in size, while malignant tumors can grow appreciably in just a few weeks. Benign tumors are also more likely to be freely movable within or on the tissue they reside on, while malignant tumors may be more difficult to move around due to local tissue invasion.</p>
        <p>Further still, benign tumors tend to be very well-circumscribed when looked at grossly, that is to say macroscopically, with imaging modalities such as MRI, or under the microscope. This means the edges of the tumor are usually very distinct and demarcated in a certain shape. This is in contrast to malignant tumors that may have an irregular shape; it may be difficult to tell where the tumor starts and ends. What's more, malignant tumors are more prone to color changes and ulceration than benign tumors.</p>

        <p>And finally, during surgical removal of a tumor, a surgeon is more likely to notice encapsulation of certain benign tumors than malignant ones. This means that a benign tumor sits in a protective sac within the body that allows for its easy removal out of the body. Malignant tumors do not do this. They don't sit in a protective sac and instead invade surrounding tissue, resulting in a more difficult procedure.</p>
        <h2 id="section---MicroscopicDifferences">Microscopic Differences</h2>
        <p>However, there are exceptions to these rules as different types of cancers will behave differently. Therefore, the only way to be sure about the diagnosis of a malignant vs. benign tumor is to look at samples of tumor cells and tissues under the microscope for defining characteristics of benign vs. malignant tumors. Under the microscope, malignant tumor cells tend be abnormal in size or shape, may have multiple nuclei, and are more frequently found in different states of division.</p>
        <p>This is quite different from benign tumor cells, which are more likely to look normal in shape and size, have one nucleus and are less likely to be found in a state of division or multiplication. Therefore, a higher&nbsp;<strong>mitotic index</strong>&nbsp;is a bigger indicator of cancer, versus a lower one, which would be more likely associated with a benign tumor. A mitotic index is the ratio of cells undergoing division to the total number of observed cells.</p>
        <h2 id="section---LessonSummary">Lesson Summary</h2>
        <p>Once again, all of these are generalities, and all features of the tumor, especially microscopic, must be taken into consideration when making a diagnosis. Just remember that a&nbsp;<strong>benign tumor</strong>&nbsp;is a tumor that does not invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body. A&nbsp;<strong>malignant tumor</strong>&nbsp;is a tumor that may invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body. A higher&nbsp;<strong>mitotic index</strong>&nbsp;is a bigger indicator of cancer versus a lower one, which would be more likely associated with a benign tumor. A mitotic index is the ratio of cells undergoing division to the total number of observed cells.</p>
